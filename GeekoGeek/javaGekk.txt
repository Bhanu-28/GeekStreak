java is platform independent platform is a combination of operating system and architecture example(windows+Intel)
in java when u compile a program it converts your program into intermediate code called java byte code this code can run on any platform that
has platform specific jvm preinstalled compare with c it has simple compilation and complex running process 
later python followed Generates intermediate code and later run by python specific virtual machines 
3 billion users and 9 million developer it is relanguage of most popular os android it is simple when compared to c and c++(pointers they have)
(they can use mutliple way to do one thing ex:-an non primitive type a object u can pass by reference pointer value and operator overloading  ) in java non pri are always 
references have strict rules and the primitives are normal objects and normal variables 
secure in java:-in c executable code run without any monitoring in java u generate intermediate byte code  and run by machine specific java virtual machine 
it works as monitoring manager can make sure unsecure are not run on machine 

-----platformIndependent
-----popular
-----simple
-----secure
-----staticallyTyped

since java dont have pointers it does directly acces memory in java its only references another reason for secure 
statically typed similar to c and c++ u need to declare variable and assign datatype but advantages are generally run faster 
Advantages like automatic garbage collection dont worry about deallocating dynamically allocated memory index out of bound check u will get exception 
There is better exceptional Handling there is Multithreading u cant write bad code compared to c++ 
when u create object an example structure or class that has many items pass value to functions  also which extra over head in java non primitive are by default references 
we have many places whre java handles issues at compile time rather  production and make code less maintainable java programs are generally more maintainable 
so java is conisdered as most by companies 

@FirstProgram
PROGRAMS ARE portable size of integer is 4 bytes fixed 
jdk--java development kit contains all tools require to code contains jre(jvm(2ways interpreter line by line other ways just intimeCompilation most used way)
&java class library)& DevTools(java compiler,debugger,docgenerator)
IDE--
Classpath--in need it will automatically set but in notepad u need to set manually classpath is something path in os where all commands present 
code should be located using classpath

In java every code we write should be a class always collection of class 
main function where execution begings 

 /*Public*/
// in mainMethod Public is anAccess specifier we use public so that main method is
// accesible for everywhere when u run jvm needs to run outside class
//static are special methods which can be called without creating object
//    main is made static always because jvm does not want to create object of classand run this method
//    its want to call main function
//    void is return type of main
//    this array of strings which are arguments of main function so when u write a
//    function java decided to receive arguments and java decided to have arg as String
//    so that u pass string set command line u can specify some special parameters and then
//    application  may use this parameters
//    args is name of array we can call it any thing
//    System is a standard java class out is an object in this class and its object of
//    print string which is used on standard output device
//    println is method in print stream class so we call it on out object


@variableAndPrimitiveDataTypes

int String Float 
different data types represent different range of data they also specify amount of memory allocate to that variable must declare datatype before declare 
java is statically typed in java ur responsibility how memory is allocated require more effort but faster 

Naming ab,AB,aBc,a1,a12,_a,a_b,ab$,$ab
cant use keyword else do for while 

Convention is camelCase(firstwordsmalllaternextwordCaptial)
nameOfPlayer
ageOfPlayer
currentYear
final int MAX_AGE=200;(for constant write variable name in uppercase multiple words separate by _)
final int MAX_PLAYERS=100;

Types of variables in java 
Primitive(basic types like int char float double byte) & Non Primitive(objects of class may be user defined or string array)
when u create an array u basically create an object 

PrimitiveDataTypes  are stored in stack memory is used for function calls and with every function u have its local record stores local data of function 

Boolean	True or False
Byte		-128 to 127(-2^7 to 2^7-1)--8 bits small variables out of which 1bit is used for sign remaining 7 bits are used to store values 
Signed numbers in java use compliment representation positive are used as it is doing simple decimal to binary and negative numbers use simple 2s compliment
short		-32768 to 32767(-2^15 to 2^15-1)--16bits bigger than byte also used to represent integers 
int        	-2147483648 to 2147483647(-2^31 to 2^31-1)--32bits 2.14billion
long        -2^63 to 2^63-1 (-9*10^18) (even big can use Big integer) 
float		single precison 32bit
Double	double precison 32 bit
char		in java char range is 16 bit bigger than c& c++ idea is to allow unicode characters (0 to 2^16-1)no sign bit ('\40000' to '\4ffff')

Non Primitive Data types are always references but primaitives are normal variables 
memory of non primitive data types always located on heap for dynamic memory allocation u get reference of dynamic in a reference variable 
use "new" operator to create memory for non primitive datatypes 

@lineObjectExplanation
Point p1 = new Point //then memory is allocated on the heap and reference to that memory in p1
Point p2= p1; p2 stores reference to p1
//int x; allocates memory for an integer variable on the function called stack
// x is not refernce memory of  x is allocated when u decalred it in a function

reference means it always hold the reference of memory location where this object is stored  
we craete variables of non primitive data type using new operator 
members of non primitive get default values like int get 0 boolean get false float 0.0
we acces member of non primitive data type using dot operator 
if u dont initialise members of non primitive data type they get default value primitive get compile error 

@WrapperClass
Primitive Type     wrapper class
char			Character
byte			Byte
short			Short
int 			Integer
long			Long
float			Float
double 		Double
boolean		Boolean
when u program in object oriented way u many times wnat to deal with objects only and thats y we have corresponding wrapper classes 
in java generics where u can pass datatype as an argument and you can create objects of a particular data type 
whole java collection framework where u have different collections like arraylist hashset hashmap for efficient implementation of problems 
all these collections are generics based and except datatype as an argument java generics and collections they dont work for primitive types 
beacuse they except a class object to be there in such cases they need wrapper class 
ex:-create an array list of integers which holds dynamic size array i cant create in int type i can create in Integer type WHICH IS A WRAPPER CLASSS 



Then y primitive java get most from c & c++ advantage is they are most effiecient if i simply want to create array of integers 
not to dela with objects i woulod love to deal with int array or craete an array in Integer it makes object and objects meet extra overhead 
primitive for efficiency but for many implementations and collections we use non primitive thats y they have 
wrapper class idea wrapper class allows u to have basic types as references and class objects 

@AutoBoxing_AutoUnBoxing
autoBoxing means ur primitive type variable becomes corresponding wrapper class object int  becomes Integer 
java caches some literal in case of small value it caches when u create more references too the same value instaead of creating new object it refer to smae literal

@TypeConversion in Java
Widening or Implicict Conversion  
There might be lose in precision in widening but u still get values  
byte->short->int->long->float->double->
		 |
		 |
             char
int x = 10;
long y = x;
float can store much as it stores exponent maximum possible value allowed in float is larger minimum possible in float is smaller than long 
Narrowing or Explicit conversion  
high chances of loss of data 
Inheritance is like base class and derived class like for EX:-Base class is animal and derived class is dog.
dog->animal possible viceversa is not possible 
@Java Input 
Bufferedreader is ussed to read character or sequence of characters funcs like read which reads a character and another read to reads array of characters and readline function to read a line
Scanner is advanced method of reading input from user can read formated input diiff functions for different data Type 

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
System.in is input stream that gives stream of bytes the input stream reader converts stream of bytes into stream of characters 
Buffered reader expects stream of characters to read data from 
in is an object in input stream once we have character stream we read that using buffered reader 
in java is a way to organize a software u have classes which contain relative functions and top of that u have pacakages 
packages contains folder like structure like import java.io.*; that there is folder java which has io folder in it in that we have BufferedReader and IOException like that classess 
the folder which has java must be in path of classpath 
 
BufferrEADER VS scANNER 
when u r using multiple threads and its  synchronize we use buffer reader  
generally faster than scanner because generally takes time to post process for  parse the input the buffer will simply read character stream also its flexible that u can specify buffer sixe to read at a time 
 
OUTPUT:-      
System.out.println();//appends in a new line
System.out.print();//comes in same line
System.out.format() or System.out.printf();//Both are same mainly used for date and time float for formatting numbers
the first parameter in this function is a format string which contains some characters and place holder 

%d is place holder for integer 
% c is palceholder for character 
%s is placeholder for string 
%f is placeholder for float
System.out.format("value of x is %d\n",x);
